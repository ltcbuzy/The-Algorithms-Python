## Algorithmic Gems
#### QuickSort

QuickSort, a fundamental sorting algorithm, epitomizes the elegance of divide and conquer. Here's a Python implementation to showcase its simplicity and efficiency:
```
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

# Example usage
my_array = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
print("Unsorted array:", my_array)
sorted_array = quicksort(my_array)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_array)
```
### Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Moving beyond sorting, let's delve into graph algorithms. Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a classic algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. Here's a Python implementation:
```
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited, queue = set(), deque([start])
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        if vertex not in visited:
            print(vertex, end=" ")
            visited.add(vertex)
            queue.extend(graph[vertex] - visited)

# Example usage
example_graph = {'A': {'B', 'C'},
                 'B': {'A', 'D', 'E'},
                 'C': {'A', 'F', 'G'},
                 'D': {'B'},
                 'E': {'B', 'H'},
                 'F': {'C'},
                 'G': {'C'},
                 'H': {'E'}}

print("BFS starting from 'A':")
bfs(example_graph, 'A')
```
